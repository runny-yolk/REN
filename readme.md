# REN Stack
A basic ReactJS, Express, and NodeJS (REN) Stack development environment.

The React generator comes with a lot of stuff, and I wanted something a bit more cut-down, and easier to jump right into. And, something that used Express out of the box.

Uses pug as a view engine.

Note: Use `npm run builddev` for much faster builds, with warnings for developers. When going to production, use `npm run build`, which applies all the proper minfication, as specified in the ReactJS docs, to get a production build of React.

`npm start` or `node app.js` can be used to start this app.
