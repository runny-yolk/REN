# REN Stack
A basic ReactJS, Express, and NodeJS (REN) Stack development environment.

The React generator comes with a lot of stuff, and I wanted something a bit more cut-down, and easier to jump right into. And, something that used Express out of the box.

Doesn't come with Babel, and instead of JSX, is made to use `react-hyperscript`. It's easy enough for you to change of course, but I've grown to dislike relying on Babel.

Start the "Hello, World!" demo with `node server.js` or `npm start`.
